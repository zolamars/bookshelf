// 🐨 you'll need to import react and createRoot from react-dom up here
import React from "react";

// 🐨 you'll also need to import the Logo component from './components/logo'

// 🐨 create an App component here and render the logo, the title ("Bookshelf"), a login button, and a register button.
// 🐨 for fun, you can add event handlers for both buttons to alert that the button was clicked

// 🐨 use createRoot to render the <App /> to the root element
// 💰 find the root element with: document.getElementById('root')
